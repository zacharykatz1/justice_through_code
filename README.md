### What is App Project 1?
This is a python script that requests:
- A user's input for total cost of food
- Number of people splitting the bill
- Percent the user would like to tip

And returns:
- Total bill (with tip)
- How much each person must pay

**Note that a 10% sales tax is assumed for the purpose of this project, but a future iteration may make sales tax a variable based on the state where the user is located.**
